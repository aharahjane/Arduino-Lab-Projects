This system uses a light sensor to detect how bright or dark the environment is and turns on a specific LED based on the light level. It can automatically adjust to changing light conditions or allow the user to manually set light thresholds.

Objective: 
The goal is to create a simple system that provides visual feedback using LEDs to show the current light level, with the flexibility for the user to adjust the settings through easy commands.

How it Works:
- The system checks the light level using a sensor.
- Based on how much light it detects, it activates the green, yellow, or red LED.
- You can choose between automatic mode, where the system sets the thresholds for you, or manual mode, where you set your own light levels.
- It displays the current light level, mode, and which LED is on in the Serial Monitor.
- The system listens for commands from a connected computer to change the settings.
